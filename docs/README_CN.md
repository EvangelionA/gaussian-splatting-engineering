# Introduction
  这个项目的目的是为了解决当前3DGS在学术探索与工程化部署的差距。当前大部分的论文都侧重于理论创新，而本项目则侧重于：

1. **工程化实现**
   
2. **稳定性能与效果优化**
   
3. **系统性的工作流程文档梳理**    

**该项目构建基于 [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).**

# Improvement Item Description
## Improverment
 Paper | Introduction | TestResults |
 ---- | ---- | ----
 [ABS-GS](https://github.com/TY424/AbsGS) | Reveal that the original adaptive density control strategy in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has the flaw of gradient collision which results in degradation, and propose homodirectional gradient as the guidance for densification. | [result](datatest/abs-gs/)
 [RAIN-GS](https://github.com/whuhxb/RAIN-GS) | show that our simple yet effective strategy consisting of sparse-large-variance (SLV) random initialization, progressive Gaussian low-pass filter control, and the Adaptive Bound-Expanding Split (ABE-Split) algorithm robustly guides 3D Gaussians to model the scene even when starting from random point cloud. | [result](datatest/rain-gs/)

## Format Support
 format | Introduction | 
 ---- | ---- 
 [USDZ](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/3dgrut) | Universal Scene Description (USD) is a framework for interchange of 3D computer graphics data. The framework focuses on collaboration, non-destructive editing, and enabling multiple views and opinions about graphics data.
 [SPZ](https://github.com/nianticlabs/spz) | spz encoded splats are typically around 10x smaller than the corresponding .ply files, with minimal visual differences between the two.

# Gaussian-Splatting PIPELINE
## Stage_1 : Accurate Camera Pose [*Crucial*]
**bad pose bad result**

Whether it's the 3DGS project or traditional photographic surveying such as SFM, MVS, etc., the preliminary work involves obtaining sufficiently accurate camera poses. This step is crucial, as any errors in this step will directly affect the subsequent reconstruction results.

**The traditional camera pose acquisition methods include**:
